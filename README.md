# 3leches-Portfolio
1st-draft of the 3leches public portfolio

In this portfolio I included my basic skills od HTML and CSS to create a site that will display my abilities.
In the portfolio are sections; about me, projects and contact. 
Inside the projects sections only one project has a link but will be fixed in the future. 
The social media section allows users to see more about who I am and what I do. 

Thank you
